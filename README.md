# Plex Playlist Sync

Create spotify and deezer playlists in your plex account using tracks from your server and keeps plex playlists in sync with original playlists. 

This DOES NOT download any songs from anywhere.

## Features
* From Spotify: Sync all the given user account's playlists to plex
* From Deezer: Sync all the given user account's public playlists and/or any given public playlist IDs to plex
* --- New ---
* Option to write missing songs as a csv
* Option to include poster and description in playlists.

## Prerequisites
### Plex
* Use Plex Credentials (**Requires You to have Remote Access on your Plex Server**):
  * Plex Username and Password
  * Plex Server Name you wish to sync with 
* Or Use Local IP and Token (**Rquires you to be connected to the same network as the plex server**):
    * Plex server's host and port
    * Plex token - [Don't know where to find it?](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)

### To use Spotify sync
* Spotify client ID and client secret - Can be obtained from [spotify developer](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)
* Spotify user ID - This can be found on spotify [account page](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/overview/)
* Spotify Redirect URI: Will allways be http://localhost:8888/callback

### To use Deezer sync
* Deezer profile ID of the account from which playlists need to sync from
  * Login to deezer.com
  * Click on your profile
  * Grab the profile ID from the URL
  *  Example: https://www.deezer.com/us/profile/9999999 - Here 9999999 is the profile ID
OR
* Get playlists IDs of playlists you want to sync
  *  Example: https://www.deezer.com/us/playlist/1313621735 - Here 1313621735 is the playlist ID
